Objectives: This isn't provided directly by the API, but you might infer it based on event types like "Hockey" (e.g., brand awareness for NHL games).
Industry Category: We can map this based on the classification (e.g., "Sports" -> "Sports", "Hockey" -> "NHL").
Geographic Focus: The city and state of the venue (e.g., "Boston, MA").
